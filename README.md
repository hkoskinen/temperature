# Temperature REST API

Simple temperature REST API where you can get current temperature for the given city.
You can also store your favorite city and get the temperature by that favorite city id.

## Getting Started

To get this project running on your local machine, you'll need to git clone it,
them import it to your chosen IDE. You'll also need to have an OpenWeatherMap API key,
which you can then add as an environmental variable. The env variable is named 
"OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY" as can be seen in application.properties file. After that
you can try and run the project. In the development phase H2 in-memory database is used.

#### Swagger documentation

Once you have the project running locally, on project's default port 9000, 
you can open the [Swagger UI](http://localhost:9000/swagger-ui.html) on your 
browser to see the REST documentation generated by Swagger.

#### H2 Database

To see the stored favorite cities, you can open up the H2 database, which you 
can find at [H2-Console](http://localhost:9000/h2-console) when you have the project 
running.
